Notes for further framework:
- User service, to find and get users (display name, ID)
    - Service like Chat that simply reads state from Redis?
    - How does it get state to write? A dedicated microservice to update?
- Channel service, to find and get channel info (ID, display name, mod list, user list)
- Remediation service, to handle punishments on different platforms
    - Count strikes for different labels, provided by modules
    - Backed by Redis, probably
Notes for technology to use:
- Netflix Hystrix for things that could be slow
- Netflix Atlas for real-time stats
- Look into GRPC
